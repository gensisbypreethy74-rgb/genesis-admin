 * The token is read inside an effect, deliberately. It looks like a job for
 * `useSyncExternalStore`, but that returns the *server* snapshot on the first
 * client render during hydration — which for localStorage is always null. The
 * redirect below would then fire on every hard navigation before the real token
 * was ever read, bouncing deep links to the dashboard. An effect runs after
 * hydration, so what it reads is the truth.
